      <p>
        When you delete your account, we will permanently remove all of the following data associated with your profile:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your account credentials (email, password).</li>
        <li>Your profile information (name, bio, profile picture).</li>
        <li>Your list of joined {appName} and blocked users.</li>
        <li>All {appName} you organized.</li>
        <li>All in-app and push notification data.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What will remain?</h2>
      <p>
        Chat messages you sent in {appName} organized by other people will remain, but they will be attributed to a "Deleted User" to protect your privacy.
      </p>

      <h2>How to Proceed</h2>
      <p>
        To confirm that you want to permanently delete your account, please enter your email address below and click the delete button.
