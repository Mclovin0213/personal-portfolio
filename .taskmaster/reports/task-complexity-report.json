		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Navigation Bar and Starfield Background",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'Implement Navigation Bar and Starfield Background' into subtasks. The subtasks should cover creating the static navigation bar component, implementing the dynamic on-scroll style change, integrating the `react-starfield` package as the application background, and ensuring the navigation links scroll smoothly to their respective page sections.",
			"reasoning": "This task combines UI creation, state management for the on-scroll effect, and integration of a third-party library. Each of these is a distinct piece of work, justifying a moderate complexity score and multiple subtasks."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Develop the Hero Section",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'Develop the Hero Section' into subtasks. One subtask should focus on creating the main text elements (header, name, headline) and ensuring they are styled for high contrast. The other subtask should cover integrating and styling the social media icon links (GitHub, LinkedIn).",
			"reasoning": "This is a straightforward presentational component. The complexity is low, primarily involving layout and styling. It can be broken down into handling the text content and the icon links."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Create the 'About Me' and 'Education' Sections",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'Create the 'About Me' and 'Education' Sections' into two distinct subtasks. The first subtask should be to build the 'About Me' section component, including layout for the personal introduction and headshot. The second subtask should be to create the 'Education' section, which involves defining a data structure for educational history and dynamically rendering it as a list.",
			"reasoning": "The task explicitly combines two distinct, simple sections. The complexity is low, involving static content and basic data mapping. Splitting it by section is the most logical expansion."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Build the Projects Section Layout and Cards",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'Build the Projects Section Layout and Cards' into subtasks. The subtasks should cover creating a reusable `ProjectCard` component that accepts project data via props, implementing the main 'Projects' section container with a responsive grid layout, and adding a subtle hover effect to the cards for interactivity.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves creating a reusable component, managing props, and implementing a responsive layout (Grid/Flexbox). This is more complex than a static section and benefits from breaking down the card, the layout, and the interaction into separate steps."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Project Card Expansion (Detailed View)",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'Implement Project Card Expansion (Detailed View)' into subtasks. The subtasks should include: creating the static UI for the detailed view modal, implementing the click-to-open functionality on each project card using state, ensuring the correct project's data is passed to and displayed in the modal, and implementing the mechanism to close the modal.",
			"reasoning": "This is a highly interactive feature requiring significant state management, event handling, and component communication (passing data to a modal). The complexity is high, and a step-by-step expansion is necessary to manage the logic."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Design and Implement the Skills Section",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'Design and Implement the Skills Section' into subtasks. Start with defining a structured data format (e.g., JSON) for skills, categorized by type. Then, create a reusable component for a single skill entry that displays an icon, name, and proficiency level. Finally, build the main section component that renders the categorized list of skills from the data.",
			"reasoning": "The complexity comes from structuring the categorized data and integrating icons. Separating data definition from the creation of the individual skill component and the final list container is a clean, logical workflow."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Experience Timeline Section",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'Develop Experience Timeline Section' into subtasks. The first subtask is to define the data array for professional experience. The second is to build the component for a single experience entry. The third, and most crucial, is to implement the CSS for the vertical timeline structure that visually connects the entries in chronological order.",
			"reasoning": "While the data mapping is simple, creating a responsive and visually appealing timeline with CSS can be tricky. This styling challenge is the main source of complexity and warrants its own subtask."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Create the 'Contact Me' Section",
			"complexityScore": 2,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'Create the 'Contact Me' Section' into two subtasks. The first should cover implementing the main section with the call-to-action text and the functional links for email, GitHub, and LinkedIn. The second, optional subtask should be to create the visual layout for a simple contact form, without any submission logic.",
			"reasoning": "This is a very low-complexity task, primarily involving static links and basic layout. The optional form is a distinct UI element that can be handled separately."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Ensure Full Responsiveness and Accessibility",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'Ensure Full Responsiveness and Accessibility' into subtasks based on area of concern. Create subtasks for: a full responsive design pass to fix layouts on all screen sizes; an accessibility audit focusing on semantic HTML, alt text, and ARIA attributes; a keyboard and screen reader navigation test; and a performance optimization pass using tools like Lighthouse.",
			"reasoning": "This task is highly complex as it affects the entire application and requires specialized knowledge in responsiveness, WCAG standards, and performance. Breaking it down by area of concern (Layout, Semantics, Navigation, Performance) is essential for a systematic approach."
