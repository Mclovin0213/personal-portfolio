Project Name: Software Engineer Portfolio

Document Version: 1.1

Date: August 1, 2025

1. Introduction
The purpose of this document is to define the requirements for a professional online portfolio for a software engineer. The website will serve as a personal brand statement and a showcase of technical skills, projects, and professional experience. The aesthetic will be sleek and space-themed, utilizing the react-starfield package for a dynamic background.

2. Goals & Objectives
The primary goals of this project are:
Showcase Technical Skills: Clearly and effectively display a range of programming languages, frameworks, and tools.
Highlight Key Projects: Provide detailed, in-depth descriptions of personal and professional projects, making them the central focus of the website.
Establish Professional Identity: Present a clean, modern, and professional-looking presence to potential employers, collaborators, and the wider tech community.
Provide Contactability: Offer multiple, easy-to-use methods for visitors to get in touch.
Success will be measured by a functional website that is visually appealing, easy to navigate, and effectively communicates the software engineer's capabilities.

3. Target Audience
Recruiters and Hiring Managers: Seeking to quickly assess technical skills, project experience, and a candidate's overall fit.
Potential Collaborators: Individuals and teams looking for a partner on a personal project.
General Public: Anyone interested in a modern portfolio website or the projects displayed.
4. Functional Requirements
4.1. General Structure & Navigation
The website will be a single-page application (SPA) with a fixed navigation bar that allows for smooth scrolling to different sections.
Nav-Bar: A sleek, transparent navigation bar with links to each section of the page. It should become more prominent on scroll.
react-starfield Background: The website's main background will be a dynamic starfield created using the react-starfield package.
4.2. Sections
Hero Section:
A prominent, space-themed header with the developer's name and a short, impactful headline (e.g., "Software Engineer & Creator").
Links to key social profiles (GitHub, LinkedIn).
About Me:
A brief, personal introduction that provides context on the developer's journey and passions.
May include a professional headshot.
Text should be clean and readable against the starfield background.
Projects (Focal Point):
This section will be the central feature of the website.
Each project will have its own dedicated card or module.
Each project card must include:
Project Title and a brief, one-sentence description.
High-quality thumbnail or hero image.
Links to the live demo and the GitHub repository.
Clicking a project card should expand to reveal a more detailed view with:
A full description of the project's purpose and features.
A list of technologies used (icons are preferred).
Detailed explanations of technical challenges and solutions.
Images or a video showcasing the project in action.
Skills:
A visual representation of skills and proficiency levels.
Must be categorized by technology type (e.g., Languages, Frameworks, Databases, Tools).
Proficiency will be represented by a clear, visual indicator (e.g., a progress bar, a color-coded rating system, or a simple text label like "Proficient," "Intermediate," "Beginner").
Icons for each technology should be used where possible.
Experience (Timeline):
A chronological timeline of professional experience.
Each entry on the timeline should include:
Company Name & Logo
Job Title
Dates of Employment
A brief, bulleted list of key responsibilities and accomplishments.
Education:
A clean list of educational background.
Each entry should include:
Institution Name
Degree/Certification and field of study
Dates of attendance
Contact Me:
A section with clear calls to action for visitors to get in touch.
Must include links to email, GitHub, and LinkedIn.
Optionally, a simple contact form can be included.
The section should encourage connection and collaboration.
5. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance: The website must be fast, with a focus on quick loading times and smooth transitions.
Responsive Design: The layout must be fully responsive, providing an optimal viewing experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. All elements should scale gracefully.
SEO: The website should be search engine optimized with appropriate meta tags and semantic HTML.
Accessibility: Adherence to WCAG standards to ensure the website is usable by people with disabilities (e.g., proper alt text for images, keyboard navigation).
Visual Design: The design will be sleek and modern, with a dark mode aesthetic that complements the space theme. The color palette will feature subtle, elegant purples (e.g., #471396, #090040) for accents and highlights. The design may also incorporate transparent or gradient elements to enhance the visual appeal.
6. Future Considerations
Blog Section: A section to share technical articles and thoughts.
Animations: More subtle, space-themed animations and transitions between sections.
Language Selector: Support for multiple languages.
CMS Integration: Integration with a headless CMS like Contentful or Sanity.io to easily update project details without changing the code.
