# Product Requirements Document (PRD) - Visual Refinement

## Overview
This document outlines the detailed requirements for visually refining the personal portfolio website, focusing on addressing identified aesthetic inconsistencies and implementing enhancements to achieve a polished, sleek, and space-themed aesthetic. The goal is to move beyond the current functional prototype to a visually complete and engaging showcase.

## Core Features

### Header
- **Fixed Navigation:** The existing fixed navigation bar will remain.
- **Smooth Scrolling:** Implement smooth scrolling behavior when navigation links are clicked, ensuring a fluid user experience between sections.
- **Active Link Styling:** Develop and apply distinct visual styling (e.g., a subtle color change, underline, or glow effect) to the navigation link corresponding to the currently active/visible section on the page.

### Hero Section
- **Content Update:** Ensure the developer's name and headline are prominently displayed.
- **Social Links:** Update `href` attributes for GitHub and LinkedIn to point to actual profile URLs.
- **Call to Action (Optional but Recommended):** Integrate a prominent, visually appealing call-to-action button (e.g., "View My Work", "Download Resume") that links to the Projects or Contact section.

### About Me
- **Image Replacement:** Replace the placeholder image (`https://via.placeholder.com/150`) with a high-quality, professional headshot or a relevant personal image.

### Projects
- **Image Replacement:** Replace all placeholder `imageUrl` values (`https://via.placeholder.com/300`) with actual, high-resolution screenshots or relevant visual assets for each project.
- **Link Updates:** Populate `demoUrl` and `repoUrl` for each project with valid live demo and GitHub repository links.
- **Detailed Content:** Ensure `title`, `description`, `fullDescription`, `challenges`, and `solutions` for each project are filled with accurate, compelling, and detailed information.
- **Project Card Hover Effects:** Enhance the existing `transform: translateY(-5px);` with additional visual cues on hover, such as a subtle box-shadow, border highlight, or background shift, to improve interactivity.
- **Modal Transition:** Implement a smooth fade-in/fade-out or scale-up animation for the `ProjectDetailModal` to enhance its appearance and disappearance.

### Skills
- **Color Refinement:** Address the perceived "off" colors to enhance vibrancy and consistency within the space theme.
    - **Accent Color Adjustment:** Evaluate and potentially adjust the `#00ffc3` (teal) accent color for icons and highlights. Consider a slightly brighter or more saturated shade if the current one appears muted against the dark backgrounds.
    - **Secondary Accent Color (Optional):** Introduce a complementary accent color (e.g., a subtle electric blue or deep violet) for minor elements, borders, or hover states to add visual depth and break monotony.
    - **Subtle Gradients (Optional):** Experiment with very subtle linear or radial gradients on `.skill-category` backgrounds to add a dynamic, space-like texture instead of flat solid colors.
- **Content Verification:** Confirm that all skill names, proficiencies, and associated icons accurately reflect the developer's capabilities.

### Experience
- **Timeline Alignment Fix:** Correct the visual misalignment and inconsistent spacing of the timeline elements.
    - **Dot Positioning:** Precisely center the `::after` pseudo-elements (the green dots) on the main vertical timeline line. This will involve adjusting their `left` property to `50%` relative to their parent `timeline-item` and using `transform: translateX(-50%);` or a calculated negative `margin-left` to ensure perfect horizontal centering on the line.
    - **Content Block Spacing:** Ensure that the `padding` on `.timeline-item.left` and `.timeline-item.right` is consistently applied and correctly offsets the content blocks from the central timeline line, creating a balanced visual flow. Adjust padding values to account for the corrected dot positioning.
- **Content Verification:** Ensure all company names, job titles, dates, and responsibilities are accurate and well-formatted.

### Education
- **Content Verification:** Confirm all educational entries are accurate and complete.

### Contact Me
- **Link Updates:** Update `mailto:`, GitHub, and LinkedIn `href` attributes with actual contact information.
- **Form Functionality (Future Consideration):** While the form is present, actual backend integration for submission is out of scope for visual refinement but noted for future development.

### Global Visual Elements
- **Custom Fonts:** Implement a custom, modern, and space-themed font (e.g., from Google Fonts) to replace the system default, enhancing the overall aesthetic.
- **Global Styling Consistency:** Review `App.css` and `index.css` to ensure consistent use of color variables, spacing units, and typography across the entire application. Define a clear color palette using CSS variables in `:root`.
- **Favicon:** Add a custom favicon to the `public` directory and link it in `index.html`.
- **"Back to Top" Button (Optional):** Implement a button that appears after scrolling down a certain distance, allowing users to quickly return to the top of the page.
- **Footer Component:** Create a dedicated `Footer.tsx` component and corresponding CSS to include copyright information, and potentially repeat social links or a mini sitemap.

## User Experience
- **Visual Consistency:** Maintain a cohesive visual language across all sections, ensuring colors, typography, and spacing are harmonious and reinforce the space-themed aesthetic.
- **Intuitive Navigation:** The smooth scrolling and active link styling will enhance navigation clarity and user feedback.
- **Improved Readability:** The corrected timeline layout will significantly improve the readability and visual appeal of the Experience section.
- **Engaging Interactions:** Enhanced hover effects on project cards and smooth modal transitions will contribute to a more dynamic and engaging user experience.
- **Comprehensive Responsiveness:** Conduct thorough testing across various device sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop) to ensure all visual elements, layouts, and interactions scale gracefully and remain aesthetically pleasing.
- **Accessibility Considerations:** While a full audit is a separate task, ensure basic accessibility principles are maintained (e.g., sufficient color contrast, semantic HTML).

## Technical Architecture
- **Frontend Framework:** React with Vite.
- **Styling:** Predominantly plain CSS, with potential for CSS variables for global theme management.
- **Specific CSS Adjustments:**
    - **Skills Section (`src/components/sections/Skills.css`):**
        - Review and potentially modify `background-color` for `.skills-section` and `.skill-category`.
        - Adjust `color` for `.skill-icon` (`#00ffc3`) to a more vibrant or complementary shade if needed.
        - Introduce new CSS variables for primary, secondary, and accent colors in `src/index.css`'s `:root` for centralized management.
    - **Experience Section (`src/components/sections/Experience.css`):**
        - Modify `.timeline-item::after` to ensure precise centering of the dots on the vertical line:
            ```css
            .timeline-item::after {
              /* ... existing styles ... */
              left: 50%; /* Position relative to the parent timeline-item */
              transform: translateX(-50%); /* Center horizontally */
              /* Adjust top as needed, e.g., top: 15px; */
            }
            ```
        - Adjust `padding-right` for `.timeline-item.left` and `padding-left` for `.timeline-item.right` to ensure consistent spacing from the central line, accounting for the dot's size and position.
        - Re-evaluate and adjust media queries for mobile responsiveness of the timeline to ensure correct alignment on smaller screens.
- **Component Structure:** Leverage existing React component structure (`App.tsx`, `Header.tsx`, `Hero.tsx`, `About.tsx`, `Projects.tsx`, `Skills.tsx`, `Experience.tsx`, `Education.tsx`, `Contact.tsx`, `ProjectCard.tsx`, `ProjectDetailModal.tsx`).
- **Content Management:** All content updates will be directly within the respective React component files (`.tsx`).

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Critical Content & Core Visual Fixes (MVP for Visual Completion)
- **Task 1.1: Content Population:**
    - Replace all placeholder images (About, Projects) with actual assets.
    - Update all `href` attributes for social links and project demos/repos.
    - Populate all project details (`title`, `description`, `fullDescription`, `challenges`, `solutions`).
    - Verify and update Education and Experience content.
- **Task 1.2: Experience Timeline Alignment:**
    - Implement precise CSS adjustments for `.timeline-item::after` to center dots on the timeline.
    - Refine padding for `.timeline-item.left` and `.timeline-item.right` for consistent spacing.
- **Task 1.3: Skills Section Color Refinement:**
    - Implement proposed color adjustments for vibrancy and consistency (e.g., accent color tweaks, subtle gradients if chosen).
- **Task 1.4: Smooth Scrolling:**
    - Implement CSS `scroll-behavior: smooth;` or equivalent JavaScript for navigation links.

### Phase 2: Visual Enhancements & Polish
- **Task 2.1: Custom Font Integration:**
    - Select and integrate a custom space-themed font.
- **Task 2.2: Active Navigation Link Styling:**
    - Implement visual feedback for the active navigation link.
- **Task 2.3: Modal Transition:**
    - Add fade-in/fade-out or scale-up animations to `ProjectDetailModal`.
- **Task 2.4: Project Card Hover Enhancements:**
    - Implement additional visual cues on project card hover (e.g., box-shadow, border).
- **Task 2.5: Favicon Integration:**
    - Create and integrate a custom favicon.
- **Task 2.6: Footer Component:**
    - Develop and integrate a `Footer.tsx` component.
- **Task 2.7: "Back to Top" Button (Optional):**
    - Implement a "back to top" button for long pages.

### Phase 3: Refinement & Optimization
- **Task 3.1: Comprehensive Responsiveness Review:**
    - Thoroughly test and refine responsiveness across a wide range of devices and screen sizes.
- **Task 3.2: Accessibility Review (Initial Pass):**
    - Conduct an initial review for basic accessibility compliance (color contrast, keyboard navigation).
- **Task 3.3: Performance Optimization (Initial Pass):**
    - Identify and address any obvious performance bottlenecks (e.g., image optimization).

## Logical Dependency Chain
1.  **Content Population (Task 1.1):** This is foundational. Without real content, visual fixes are less impactful.
2.  **Core Visual Fixes (Tasks 1.2, 1.3, 1.4):** These directly address the identified visual discrepancies and improve core interactions.
3.  **General Visual Enhancements (Phase 2 Tasks):** These build upon the corrected foundation to add polish and aesthetic appeal.
4.  **Refinement & Optimization (Phase 3 Tasks):** These are final passes to ensure quality, performance, and broad usability.

## Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk: Visual Discrepancies Persist:**
    - Mitigation: Implement an iterative design and review process, including regular visual checks against the `webpage.jpeg` and direct user feedback.
- **Risk: Content Sourcing Delays:**
    - Mitigation: Clearly communicate the need for actual content (images, text, links) from the developer as a critical dependency for Phase 1.
- **Risk: Cross-Browser/Device Inconsistencies:**
    - Mitigation: Utilize standard CSS practices, leverage browser developer tools for testing, and conduct testing on a variety of real devices or emulators.
- **Risk: Performance Degradation with Enhancements:**
    - Mitigation: Monitor performance metrics throughout Phase 2 and 3, optimizing assets and code as needed.

## Appendix
- **Reference Image:** `webpage.jpeg` serves as the primary visual reference for the current state and desired improvements.
- **Current Codebase:** The existing React components and CSS files (`src/**/*.tsx`, `src/**/*.css`) form the basis for all modifications.
- **Previous Analysis:** This PRD builds directly upon the detailed visual analysis provided previously, specifically addressing the Skills section color perception and the Experience timeline layout issues.
