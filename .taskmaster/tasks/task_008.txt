# Title: Develop Experience Timeline Section
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Build the 'Experience' section as a chronological timeline of professional experience. Each entry should include Company Name, Job Title, Dates, and a list of key responsibilities.
# Details:
Use CSS to create a vertical timeline structure. Map over an array of job data to dynamically generate the timeline entries. Company logos can be included for visual appeal.

# Test Strategy:
Review the Experience section to ensure all entries are displayed in the correct chronological order and contain all required information (company, title, dates, responsibilities).
