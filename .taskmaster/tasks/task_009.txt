# Task ID: 9
# Title: Create the 'Contact Me' Section
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the 'Contact Me' section with clear calls to action. Must include links to email, GitHub, and LinkedIn. An optional simple contact form can be included.
# Details:
Links should be functional (`mailto:` for email). If a contact form is included, it can be a UI placeholder initially, without backend logic. The design should encourage connection.

# Test Strategy:
Click on the email, GitHub, and LinkedIn links to verify they function as expected. If a form is built, check its layout and input field validation (if any).
