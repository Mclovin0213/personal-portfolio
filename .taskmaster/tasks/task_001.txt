# Task ID: 1
# Title: Project Setup and Core SPA Structure
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize a new React project, set up the basic file structure for a single-page application (SPA), and install initial dependencies including the `react-starfield` package.
# Details:
Use Vite or Create React App to bootstrap the project. Establish a component-based architecture with folders for sections (e.g., Hero, About, Projects). Install `react-starfield` and any other foundational libraries.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that the React development server runs without errors using `npm run dev` or `npm start`. Check `package.json` to confirm all necessary dependencies are installed correctly.
