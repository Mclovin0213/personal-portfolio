# Task ID: 7
# Title: Design and Implement the Skills Section
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a visually representative 'Skills' section. Categorize skills by technology type (e.g., Languages, Frameworks) and use icons and a clear visual indicator for proficiency levels.
# Details:
Structure skill data in a JSON object or file for easy management. Use an icon library like `react-icons`. The proficiency indicator can be a simple text label ('Proficient', 'Intermediate') or a visual bar.

# Test Strategy:
Check that skills are correctly categorized and that each skill displays its corresponding icon and proficiency level. Ensure the layout is clean and easy to understand.
