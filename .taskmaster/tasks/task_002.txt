# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Navigation Bar and Starfield Background
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a sleek, transparent, fixed navigation bar that becomes more prominent on scroll. Integrate the `react-starfield` package as the main dynamic background for the entire application.
# Details:
The navigation bar should be a fixed-position component with smooth-scrolling links to page sections. A scroll event listener should trigger a style change (e.g., adding a background color). The `react-starfield` component should be placed in the root layout component.

# Test Strategy:
Scroll the page to confirm the navigation bar's appearance changes as specified. Verify the starfield is visible, animates correctly, and does not hinder performance. Test navigation links to ensure they scroll to the correct sections.
