# Task ID: 10
# Title: Ensure Full Responsiveness and Accessibility
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9
# Priority: high
# Description: Refactor and test the entire application to ensure it is fully responsive on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. Implement accessibility features according to WCAG standards.
# Details:
Use CSS media queries to adjust layouts for different screen sizes. Add `alt` text to all images, use semantic HTML tags, and ensure the site is navigable using only a keyboard.

# Test Strategy:
Use browser developer tools to test the layout on various screen sizes (e.g., 375px, 768px, 1280px). Use a screen reader to test navigation. Run a Lighthouse audit and aim for scores above 90 in Accessibility, Performance, and SEO.
