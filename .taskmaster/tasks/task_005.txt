# Task ID: 5
# Title: Build the Projects Section Layout and Cards
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the main 'Projects' section, which is the focal point of the portfolio. Create a responsive grid layout for project cards, each displaying a title, a brief description, a thumbnail image, and links to the live demo and GitHub repository.
# Details:
Create a reusable `ProjectCard` component that accepts project data via props. Use CSS Grid or Flexbox to arrange the cards. Add a subtle hover effect to indicate interactivity.

# Test Strategy:
Confirm that project cards are displayed in a responsive grid. Check that each card shows the correct title, description, image, and that the 'Live Demo' and 'GitHub' links are present.
