# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement Project Card Expansion (Detailed View)
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Add functionality for clicking a project card to expand or open a modal, revealing a detailed view. This view must include a full description, a list of technologies used (with icons), and details on technical challenges and solutions.
# Details:
Use component state to manage the visibility of the detailed view (modal or inline expansion). The detailed view should be populated with data specific to the clicked project. Use an icon library for technology logos.

# Test Strategy:
Click on a project card and verify that the detailed view appears. Confirm it displays the correct project's full description, tech stack, and images. Test the closing mechanism of the detailed view.
